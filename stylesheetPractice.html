         <h2>What is color?</h2>
         <hr>
         <p>
            Color (<a href=""> American English</a>), or colour (Commonwealth English), is the characteristic of visual
            perception
            described through color categories, with names such as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or purple. This
            perception of color derives from the stimulation of photoreceptor cells (in particular cone cells in the
            human
            eye and other vertebrate eyes) by electromagnetic radiation (in the visible spectrum in the case of humans).
            Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelengths of
            the light that is reflected from them and their intensities. This reflection is governed by the object's
            physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.

            By defining a color space, colors can be identified numerically by coordinates, which in 1931 were also
            named in global agreement with internationally agreed color names like mentioned above (red, orange, etc.)
            by the International Commission on Illumination. The RGB color space for instance is a color space
            corresponding to human trichromacy and to the three cone cell types that respond to three bands of light:
            long wavelengths, peaking near 564–580 nm (red); medium-wavelength, peaking near 534–545 nm (green); and
            short-wavelength light, near 420–440 nm (blue).[1][2] There may also be more than three color dimensions in
            other color spaces, such as in the CMYK color model, wherein one of the dimensions relates to a color's
            colorfulness).

            The photo-receptivity of the "eyes" of other species also varies considerably from that of humans and so
            results in correspondingly different color perceptions that cannot readily be compared to one another. Honey
            bees and bumblebees have trichromatic color vision sensitive to ultraviolet but insensitive to red. Papilio
            butterflies possess six types of photoreceptors and may have pentachromatic vision.[3] The most complex
            color
            vision system in the animal kingdom has been found in stomatopods (such as the mantis shrimp) with up to 12
            spectral receptor types thought to work as multiple dichromatic units.[4]
