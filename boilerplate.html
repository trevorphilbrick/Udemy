         <p>I intend to give you many bowls<br>
            For apples and loose change.<br>

            What would suit you<br>
            better than a bowl.<br>

            Round with primacy,<br>
            place for holding.<br>

            You are not round<br>
            like a woman<br>
            but you have more<br>
            roundness than most men.</p>

         <p>In Korea,<br>
            every day a woman<br>
            prays for her son to come
            home.<br>
            <br>
            Her prayer:<br>
            <br>
            Every day she puts clear water
            in a bowl.<br>

            She placed it in the garden.</p>
