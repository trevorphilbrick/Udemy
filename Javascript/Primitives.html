      js has one number Types
      positive numbers
      negative numbers

      decimal numbers

      subtraction
      multiplication
      division
      modulo (percent sign)
         example 19 % 2 = 1
         remainder after all whole numbers have been removed
      exponents(** raises number to the nth power)
      4**3 = 4 to the 3rd power

PEMDAS- the order math is executed
      parentheses
      exponents
      multiplication
      division
      addition
      strings
Variables
      variables are like labels  for values
         let "someName" = something;
            "let numHens = 5;
            undefined
            let numRoosters = 1;
            undefined
            numHens + numRoosters
            6
            let numChickens = numHens + numRoosters;
            undefined
            numChickens
            6
            numHens = numHens + 1
            6"
      Updating variables can be done by declaring the variable is now equal to itself + or - a number
      "score = score + 5;"
      and can be automated to add or subtract or multiply and divide each time it is recalled
      "score += 5;
      "score -= 5;
      "score *= 5;
      "score /= 5;"
      One can be added or subtracted by typing the variable name and then ++ or --
      "let numLives = 9;
      numLives--
      8
      numLives++
      9"
