      <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken">fowl</a>, a subspecies of the red junglefowl
         (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population
         of
         23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than
         any
         other bird or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their
         meat
         and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens
         were
         not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[3][4]</p>
      <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but
         with the <a href="#">clade</a> found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the
         Indian
         subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece
         by
         the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives
         birth
         every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of
         Thutmose III.[7][8][9]</p>
